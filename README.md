# RATURU: Home Fever

**RATURU: Home Fever** is a puzzle-survival game created for **GIMJAM ITB 2025**, our very first game jam as a team.  
The name "RATURU" comes from the Javanese phrase "ora turu," meaning "not sleeping," symbolizing our hard work and sleepless nights to complete this game within just one week as newcomers to game development.

In this game, you play as a young child suffering from a high fever, trapped inside a strange and eerie dream. To escape, you must solve intricate puzzles scattered throughout this surreal dreamworld. But beware, something sinister watches you from the shadows. As the fever worsens, the line between nightmare and reality blurs. Can you solve the puzzles, uncover the mystery, and wake up before itâ€™s too late?

## Theme Explanation

The theme for this game jam was **"Too Many."**  
For *RATURU: Home Fever*, we interpreted this theme as **"Too Many Doors."**  

In all three maps, the player encounters rooms filled with a large number of doors. These doors represent the confusion and overwhelming feelings inside the child's feverish mind.  

The many doors create a sense of mystery and disorientation, emphasizing the surreal and unsettling atmosphere of the dream. Players must decide which doors to open, adding a layer of puzzle-solving that ties directly to the theme of having too many choices and paths.
